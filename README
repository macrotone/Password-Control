This is the 0.0.4 release of the Password Control plugin for Joomla 1.7.
The intent is to enhance (or more accurately provide) some password checking to Joomla 
over a simple comparison that the two specified passwords are identical.

This version adds the ability to handle multiple passwords for a user, and allows Jomla update functionality.
